Simulations Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods

Markov chain Monte Carlo is a powerful method to estimate parameters that involve a mathematically intractable normalization constant. We discuss the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in problems with one unknown and two unknown parameters. In the one-parameter case, we discuss the Beta-Binomial model. Due to conjugate prior distribution, the actual posterior distribution is known, providing an opportunity to compare our sampler output to the actual posterior distribution. We illustrate the two-parameter case with an example of the normal distribution with unknown mean and variance.
